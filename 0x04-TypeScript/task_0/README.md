## Description

This task demonstrates basic TypeScript usage by defining a `Student` interface and rendering a table of students in the browser. The table displays each student's first name and location.

## Features

- Creates two student objects and stores them in an array.
- Dynamically generates an HTML table showing each student's first name and location.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the project:**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```sh
   npm run start-dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to the provided local address to view the table.

## File Structure

- [`js/main.ts`](js/main.ts): Main TypeScript source file.
- [`webpack.config.js`](webpack.config.js): Webpack configuration.
- [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json): TypeScript configuration.
- [`.eslintrc.js`](.eslintrc.js): ESLint configuration.

## Usage

The table will be rendered automatically in the browser when you run the development server.
